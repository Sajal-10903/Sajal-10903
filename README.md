## 👋 Hi, I'm Sajal

I'm an MCA (AI & Data Science) student who builds **practical machine learning projects** — not just notebooks.

I focus on:
- turning raw, messy data into usable datasets
- building ML models for clear business and analytical problems
- creating end-to-end pipelines instead of isolated experiments  

I care more about **working systems** than theoretical perfection.

## 🔍 What I Work On

- Data analysis & preprocessing using Python  
- Machine Learning models for prediction & classification  
- Recommendation systems & applied NLP projects  
- Clear evaluation, limitations, and real-world use cases

## 🚀 Featured Projects

🔹 **Amazon Price Tracker Bot**  
Tracks product prices and sends alerts when prices drop.

🔹 **Microlearning Generator**  
Generates short notes and flashcards from long educational content.

🔹 **Customer Churn Prediction**  
Predicts customers at risk of leaving using machine learning.

(Each project has a detailed README explaining the approach.)
